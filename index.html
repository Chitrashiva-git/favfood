        <p>Black Sticky Rice Pudding is a popular Vietnamese dessert. 
            By using a pressure cooker such as an Instant Pot to make the 
            rice pudding, you can cut down on cooking time significantly.
            The instructions in that recipe call for soaking black sticky
            rice for several hours. I recently tried using my pressure 
            cooker to make the sticky rice pudding without soaking the 
            rice, and it worked! So now I can put together my favorite
            dessert quickly. </p>

     <h2> Ingredients :</h2>
     <img src="images/pic.jpg" alt="Rice Pudding" height="400" width="300" align="right"> <br>
         <ul>
        <li> <small>3/4 </small>cup - Black Sticky Rice</li>
        <li> 2 <small>1/4</small> cups - Water</li>
        <li> Rock Salt - add pinch </li>
        <li> 4 tablespoons - Honey (to taste, sugar is okay too)</li>
        <li> Add some cubed mangoes for optional</li>
        <li> Add some yogurt</li>
        <li> If you want any additional toppings like fruits or nuts, you can add it for your wish. </li>
     </ul>
     <h2> Directions :</h2>
     <div> 1. Rinse black sticky rice under water, then add it to the pressure cooker. Then add water and a pinch of salt. 
       Rice Cooking process: Soak for 12 hours, 1 cup with 5-6 cups of water, cook for 50 mins in the pot. Try to avoid 
       in the pressure cooker, but if you used set to 8 - 10 whistles. </div>
    <div>2. Let the pressure release naturally (or quick release after 7-10 minutes of natural release). Stir in 
       honey (or sugar) and adjust the sweetness to your liking.</div>
     <div>3. If you want the rice pudding to be thicker, you can change the cooking mode to Saut√© to thicken it. If it's 
        too thick, just add a splash of water to thin it out.</div>

        <h2> Notes :</h2>
        <div> Please note that the black sticky rice pudding will continue to thicken as it cools down as well 
            as when you refrigerate it. Each pressure cooker brand and model may differ slightly, so you may 
            want to adjust the cooking time slightly to achieve the desired texture and consistency when you
            make it the second time. My favorite way to enjoy black sticky rice pudding is to serve it with
            yogurt (and some cubed mangoes, optional). You can let the rice pudding cool slightly, then add
            it to serving bowl with yogurt and some crushed ice. Another option is to refrigerate the rice 
            pudding, and then serve it with yogurt later. This dessert is very popular in Vietnam.</div>
