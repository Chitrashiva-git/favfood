    <p>Black Sticky Rice Pudding is a popular Vietnamese dessert. 
     By using a pressure cooker such as an Instant Pot to make the 
     rice pudding, you can cut down on cooking time significantly.
     The instructions in that recipe call for soaking black sticky
     rice for several hours. I recently tried using my pressure 
     cooker to make the sticky rice pudding without soaking the 
     rice, and it worked! So now I can put together my favorite
     dessert quickly.</p>
